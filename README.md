This project was created for learning purposes, a loong time ago (2010) and later it got extended for a academic project about WebForms Similarity (WF-Sim).
The idea of the project is to easily alter between a graph and table view. And use the table as data source for running similarity/clusterization algorithms, for which the results can be easily studied as a graph (this node is X similar to that node).

There are some cool small algorithms, such as
- Weiszfeld algorithm
- A polynomial similarity algorithm
- A medium-shift clusterer
